# SIT-628-Final-Project
This is an individual project for EE 628: Deep Learning

### Proposal
Deep Learning as a subfield of Machine Learning has been applied to lots of fields including computer vision, speech recognition, natural language processing, audio recognition, social network filtering, machine translation, and medical image analysis. Classification is such a good case for deep learning. It is pretty easier for human brain to judge if some pets are dogs or cats than computer. This project would just aim to implement a program to classify pictures in two labels, dog or cat. Different model and different model parameters would cause different accuracy rates of the program results, and this project would try to find the best result.

### Data Description
This dataset is downloaded from Kaggle. The train folder contains 25,000 images of dogs and cats. Each image in this folder has the label as part of the filename. The test folder contains 12,500 images, named according to a numeric id. For each image in the test set, you should predict a probability that the image is a dog (1 = dog, 0 = cat).

### TODO
* Reading the dataset
* Processing the data
* Defining the model
* Defining the loss function and optimizer
* Training the model
* Validating the model
* Evaluating the model
